        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>As a student in the Honors College at <a href="http://cms.bsu.edu/" target="_blank">Ball State University</a>, I am actively pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor in Computer Technology. I am expected to graduate in 2017. I thoroughly enjoy working with computers and technology on all levels; from Operating Systems to Coding to Hardware, I am always striving to learn more about what I love. Recently, I've been doing a lot of work with Angular.js and learning more about iOS, including the use of SpriteKit. I've even created my own add-on for developers because I found that SpriteKit was lacking something I thought to be essential. Check out SKButton on my projects page to learn more!</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Hailing from the small town of <a href="http://www.versaillesohio.cc" target="_blank">Versailles, OH</a>, I am a proud graduate of the Versailles High School Class of 2013. Throughout high school, my focuses were grades, music, and sports. While graduating high school with ~3.9 GPA, I also was a varsity golfer and bowler; as if that wasn't enough, I was a dance captain in our show choir and I played a lead role in the musical every year. Coming to college, I decided to study Computer Science because I always loved math and was intrigued by the calculator programming that a friend had taught me. At the time, I never thought that learning something so small would drive me to the place I am now.</p>

        <h5>Recent Activity</h5>
        <p>This last semester was full of new activities! Over the course of the semester, I created a number of new applications/websites, including 2 games for a 70" touchscreen, multiple iOS apps, and even a Pokemon website. These all used a variety of technologies, including PhaserJS, Angular.js, Slim PHP, iOS Swift, iOS SpriteKit, and Android. Check them all out on the projects page!</p>
