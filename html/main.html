        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>A graduate of the class of 2013 at Versailles High School, I am currently a sophomore at <a href="http://cms.bsu.edu/">Ball State University</a>. A student in the Honors College, I am actively pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor in Computer Technology. I am expected to graduate in 2017. I thoroughly enjoy working with computers and technology on all levels; from Operating Systems to Coding to Hardware, I am always striving to learn more about what I love. I currently am in the process of creating this website, and with a group I have released my first Android app. I am also learning iOS Swift and Objective-C development in my spare time, a goal I've been targeting for quite some time now.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Hailing from the small town of <a href="http://www.versaillesohio.cc">Versailles, OH</a>, I am a proud graduate of the Versailles High School Class of 2013. Throughout high school, my focuses were grades, music, and sports. While graduating high school with ~3.9 GPA, I also was a varsity golfer and bowler; as if that wasn't enough, I was a dance captain in our show choir and I played a lead role in the musical every year. Coming to college, I decided to study Computer Science because I always loved math and was intrigued by the calculator programming that a friend had taught me. At the time, I never thought that learning something so small would drive me to the place I am now.</p>

        <h5>Recent Activity</h5>
        <p>This last weekend I attended <a href="http://www.hackillinois.org/">HackIllinois 2015</a> at the <a href="http://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>. Our group decided to try out the new iOS Swift, and we made an app that's relatable to every college student. While we didn't earn any prizes, we all learned a lot about Swift and got to see some cool new hacks. So go ahead, check out our app on the <a ng-click="projectClick()">projects</a> page!</p>
