            "Http-Cancellable (named angular-http-cancellable on npmjs.com) is a simple and sweet little Angular library that overlays the default $http request service to make requests cancellable. While this seems like a simple thing, I frequently ran into instances where I may need to cancel a network request in Angular, but there was no built in support for it. After numerous instances of this, and finding no easy solutions on npm, I finally decided to make my own and publish it for everyone else to benefit.",
            "This project was an extremely difficult build as I had made requests cancellable a few times before; however, I did have to take extra time this time to make sure the code was as simple and clean as possible while still being readable. I even took extra time in this project to document all the code using jsdocs, and made testing for the code using mocha + chakram."
